# NUnit_Web
simple test automation framework on C# with Selenium WebDriver and NUnit
Only one test for amazon
Using the Page Object pattern
using Selenium ChromeDriver preference so you don't need to download chrome driver.exe file
I tried to run this test on mac but unfortunately, it didn't work =), run it only on windows.
I believe it can help somebody to remind about webElements in C# and C# test automation generally.
And for me of course. Before the day when I started implementing this framework, I thought that I have good knowledge in c#, 
but after 2ys working with java on the mac I realized it is not =)
